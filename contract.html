    <main>
   
        <p>I, <a href="introducton.html">Tilahun S. Sema</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring WEB250-N890 Adv. Markup & Scripting with my instructor, D.I. Von Briesen.

            I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absences.</p>
